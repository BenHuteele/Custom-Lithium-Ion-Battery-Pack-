# Custom Lithium Ion Battery

Since 2008, Huizhou JB Battery Technology Limited has been designing and assembling custom battery solutions. We provide battery pack assemblies in all chemistries and for all electronic and industrial applications, all built to match our customers’ unique requirements. From medical devices and military equipment to emergency lighting systems and many industrial applications, such as lithium ion forklift battery,AGV robot battery,golf cart battery,floor cleaning machine battery,we can design and manufacture the perfect portable power solution for your needs.

Lithium-ion battery ( Li-ion or LIB ) includes cylindrical steel shell and square aluminum shell. The anode materials include lithium cobalt carbonate, lithium manganese carbonate, lithium iron phosphate, nickel cobalt manganese and nickel cobalt aluminum.

Nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH or Ni-MH) is a type of rechargeable battery with good performance. It divides into high voltage and low voltage. NiMH have replaced NiCd for many roles, notably small rechargeable batteries.

Lithium-Polymer battery( LiPo or LIP ) is a rechargeable battery whose electrolyte is solid. Pack with Aluminum plastic film. Compared with Li-ion , it is higher energy density, more miniaturization, ultra-thin, lightweight, and high safety.
